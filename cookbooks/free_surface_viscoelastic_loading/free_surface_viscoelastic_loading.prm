# This model applies a surface load (using the traction
# boundary condition) on a free surface overlying 
# a viscoelastic box. It approximates the analytical solution
# of Nakiboglu and Lambeck (1982) for an applied/removed
# axisymmetric cylindrical load over a viscoelastic half-space.
#
# The elastic time step is set larger than the the numerical
# times step and stress averaging is turned on, in order
# to smooth out fluctuations due to instantaneous stress
# changes.
